&lt;p&gt;I was accepted by Tufts summer research program to work at the robotics lab for
10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-do&quot;&gt;What did I do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program is designated for CS, math, and Data Science students, where 
everyone is assigned to be mentored by a professor. I was assigned to Professor
Elaine Short, who does research in robotics and human-robot interaction. Her
works focus on plenty different assistive technology application research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work this summer primarily involved in working on developing a framework for
social robot navigation. Our idea came from mobility device that 
professor operates. We believed that collecting data from mobility device would
give a better sense in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ethan Hsu</name><email>Ethan.Hsu@duke.edu</email></author><category term="posts" /><summary type="html">Introduction I was accepted by Tufts summer research program to work at the robotics lab for 10 weeks.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How is this website built</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/2023/06/29/on-the-website.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How is this website built" /><published>2023-06-29T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-06-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/2023/06/29/on-the-website</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/2023/06/29/on-the-website.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wanted to build a website before. When I was doing frontend developing
for a project, I thought about writing one in &lt;abbr&gt;ReactJS&lt;/abbr&gt;. However, it
seems overkill to write a static website with it, but I also don’t want to simply
copying down templates and add my own text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I learned that a lot of Ph.D. students and Professors use Jekyll to
simplify the making of their websites. I thought it was a good idea to learn
the framework, so here we are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-details&quot;&gt;Technical Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website is powered by Jekyll, I cloned the structure of existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://cvless.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;template&lt;/a&gt;
online. This greatly reduced the time needed for me to import icons and writing
CSS from scratch. Under this structure, I add my own JavaScript and CSS to
build the website. I am still testing out different things and adding more content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-dos&quot;&gt;To-dos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning to add a detail section of my education and coursework, potentially
I might even add a brief comments of each course I’ve taken in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also find it hard to organize my past projects because I never really dedicated
a large amount of time to a single project. Usually my way of learning is to
build new things from existing works (class homework) or taking courses with
final projects. With this website, it might be easier to share things that I did.&lt;/p&gt;
