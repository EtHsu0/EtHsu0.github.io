# About Me

I recently graduated from Duke University with BEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering with concentration in Machine Learning, BS in Computer Science, and a minor in mathematics.

Over the past few years, I did research in machine learning, internships in software development, and other different works. 

This website tracks what I've been doing and my web [Resume](/resume). A list of courses I've been doing each semester can be found at [timeline](/timeline). Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.
