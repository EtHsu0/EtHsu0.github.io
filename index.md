# About Me

I am a senior at Duke University studying <span id="index_major" style="text-decoration:underline">Computer Science</span>.  
I am currently doing **software engineering internship** with Capital One for Summer 2024.

Over the past few years, I did research in machine learning, projects in software development, and other different works. I am currently excited about various opportunities like Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Applied Scientist, Grad School, and Quant Developer.

This website will track what I've been doing, including my coursework and projects. You can find my web [Resume](/resume) here. Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.
