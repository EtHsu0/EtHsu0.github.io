# About Me

I am a senior at Duke University studying <span id="index_major" style="text-decoration:underline">Computer Science</span>.  
I am currently doing **software engineering internship** with Capital One for Summer 2024.

Over the past few years, I did research in machine learning, projects in software development, and other different works. I am currently excited about various opportunities like Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Applied Scientist, Grad School, and Quant Developer.

This website tracks what I've been doing and my web [Resume](/resume). A list of what I've been doing each semester can be found at [timeline](/timeline). Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.
