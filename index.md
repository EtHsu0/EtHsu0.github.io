# About Me

I am a Junior studying in <span id="index_major" style="text-decoration:underline">Computer Science</span>.

I am currently doing research in Machine Learning, but I am also excited about opportunities in
other career options like Software Engineer, Hardware Engineer, and
Quantitative Developer.

This website will try to keep track of what I've been doing in College.
You can find my web [Resume](/resume) here. I will be updating this frequently. Feel free to reach out to me!

<!-- 
This is the home page. It can be used for a short introduction. [Click here](/resume) to see the full CV, and [here](/cv.pdf) to download a print version. The theme also ships with a blog: [click here](/posts) to scroll posts from the most recent. Finally, [click here](/404) to see a page that can't be found.

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).

Below is a list of blog posts included for illustrative purposes. Make sure to delete or modify them before deploying your website. -->
