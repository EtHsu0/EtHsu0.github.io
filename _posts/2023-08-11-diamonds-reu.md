## Introduction
I was accepted by Tufts summer research program to work at the robotics lab for
10 weeks.

## What did I do?
The program is designated for CS, math, and Data Science students, where 
everyone is assigned to be mentored by a professor. I was assigned to Professor
Elaine Short, who does research in robotics and human-robot interaction. Her
works focus on plenty different assistive technology application research.

My work this summer primarily involved in working on developing a framework for
social robot navigation. Our idea came from mobility device that 
professor operates. We believed that collecting data from mobility device would
give a better sense in the real world.
